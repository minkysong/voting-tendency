		<h1>The Voting History of the Voters</h1>
			<p>
				Next, we will study the voting history of the surveyed population. 
				The plot below shows what percentage of people voted or did not vote in the six past elections.
				The trend of the percentage of people who voted for each income category are similar to that of Figure 02:
				the people with high income have voted more during the past elections, while the people with low income have voted less.
				The plot also looks like a wave which shows that more people tend to vote for the presidential election than the congressional elections. 
				Thus, we can learn that the population perceives presidential elections more importantly than the congressional election. 
				One event that does not follow this is the Hispanic constituency for the 2010 congressional elections: 
				Hispanic voters with the income category of '$40-75k' and 'Less than $40k' voted more for the 2010 congressional election than the 2008 presidential elections.

			<p>
				On the other hand, the trend of the percentage of people who voted for each racial category resembles that of Figure 02.
				Across all income categories, the Black constituencies have frequently voted the most out of all racial categories, 
				which is followed by the White constituencies.
				The Hispanic constituencies have voted more than the other/mixed constituency for the income of $120k or more,
				while they have voted less for the $75-125k and $40-75k.
				However, for the less than $40k income category, it is difficult to determine whether it is the Hispanics voter or the other/mixed voter who voted more, because, 
				as described above, the Hispanic constituencies voted more for some of the elections while other/mixed constituencies voted more for the other elections.

			<p>
				One warning about this plot is that the data have some inconsistency between its voting history and voting tendency categorization.
				The voting history was aggregated based on question 21 of the survey, which asked which of the recent elections did they voted in
				<a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/non-voters/nonvoters_codebook.pdf">[1]</a>.
				However, some people's voting history does not reflect the voting tendency they are categorized as.
				Therefore, this voting tendency categorization may not be the most accurate representation of how the U.S. population votes.
