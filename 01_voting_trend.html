		<h1>The Voting Trend of the Voters based on Race</h1>
			<p>
				First, we will examine if there are any differences in the voting tendencies based on people's race within each income category. 
				The visualization shows what percentage of the people always vote, sporadically vote, or never vote for each racial and income category.
				These are the definition of each voting tendencies:
				<ul>
					<li>People who always votes are people who voted for all or all-but-one of the past elections they were eligible.</li>
					<li>People who sporadically votes are people who voted for fewer than all-but-one yet more than once in the past elections they were eligible.</li>
					<li>People who rarely or never votes are people who never voted or voted only once for the past elections they were eligible.</li>
				</ul>

					<figcaption>Fig. 02: The percentage of the population's voting tendency based on their race and income.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				Through this plot, we can see that the White voters and the Black voters have similar voting patterns across all income categories. 
				On the other hand, Hispanic and others/mixed voters have more people who do not vote compared to White and Black constituencies. 
				This pattern is more apparent for the income category of '$125k or more' and '$40-75k.' 
				We can also observe that the number of people who always vote or sporadically votes decreases as the income category decreases too. 
				The only exception to this is the others/mixed voters: 
				they have more percentage of people who always or sporadically vote in the '$75-125k' income category than the '$125k or more' category.
			</p>

			<p>
				One thing to note about the visualization is that, as according to the information on the main page of this website, 
				the sample population consists much more White voters compared to any other race.
				Therefore, it is much more rational to generalize the voting trend of the White voters compared to other ethnicities.
