# voting_tendency

The voting_tendency project is the final project for the Data Visualization class. 

Using data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/non-voters), I created four data visualization showing how voting tendency differs for each race group. <br>
This repository includes a Python file *votingTendency.py* which contains the code to create the data visualizations.
