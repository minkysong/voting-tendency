		<h1>Will the People Vote in the Future Election?</h1>
			<p>
				To further the analyzation, we will study whether if there is any difference on how people plan to vote for the future election
				depending on their race or income.
				<!-- One thing different about this plot is that it is not expressed as a percentage.-->
				Using this plot, we can see that when the income category decreases, there are more percentage of people who decides to not participate in the election.
				This observation is in line with the foundings of figure 02 and figure 03.
				However, with a few exceptions, the proportion of people who plans to vote are similar across all racial categories.
				The few exceptions are the Hispanic constituency of the '$75-125k' income category and the other/mixed constituency for the '$40-75k' category.
