        <h1>Analyzing Voting Trend in United States by Race</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            It is a widely known fact that people who vote often are more likely to have high income and higher education
            <a href="https://econofact.org/voting-and-income">[1]</a>.
            We have also found out that young people are more likely to not vote compared to elders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/upshot/youth-voting-2020-election.html">[2]</a>.
            However, there is no clear proposition on people's voting tendencies based on their race &#8212;
            most of the research on voting tendency based on racial demographics only shows the percentage of the voting turnout out.
            They do not study if the people of some specific ethnicities chose to vote or not
            <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/26/what-the-2020-electorate-looks-like-by-party-race-and-ethnicity-age-education-and-religion/">[3]</a>.
            Through analyzing the voting pattern of American population, we will examine if the people vote differently based on their race.
            
        <h2>About the data</h2>

            The data for the research comes from a survey for <cite>FiveThirtyEight</cite> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/non-voters-poll-2020-election/">[4]</a>.
            You can also get the survey data from their GitHub <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/non-voters">[5]</a>.
            In the end, they surveyed 5,355 citizens of the United States. The sample includes 3,710 White people, 932 Black people, 813 Hispanic people, and 381 other/mixed people.
            It also includes 1,394 people who makes more than $125k a year, 1,628 people who makes $75-125k a year, 1,396 people who makes $40-75k a year, and $1,418 people who makes less than $40k a year.
            The following figure a breakdown on how does each race and income makes up the sample population.

            </figure>

            In the end, the sample was weighted to represent the population of the U.S. citizens accurately according to the United States Census Burea.
            One thing to note is that the survey was taken from September 15th to September 25th of 2020, which is before the 2020 presidential elections.

        <h2>The Voting Trend of the Voters based on Race</h2>
			<p>
				First, we will examine if there are any differences in the voting tendencies based on people's race within each income category. 
				The visualization shows what percentage of the people always vote, sporadically vote, or never vote for each racial and income category.
				These are the definition of each voting tendencies:
				<ul>
					<li>People who always votes are people who voted for all or all-but-one of the past elections they were eligible.</li>
					<li>People who sporadically votes are people who voted for fewer than all-but-one yet more than once in the past elections they were eligible.</li>
					<li>People who rarely or never votes are people who never voted or voted only once for the past elections they were eligible.</li>
				</ul>
				<figure>
					<img src="figures/01_stackedBarPlot.png" class="responsive"> <!--class="center" style = "width: 1000px">-->
					<figcaption>Fig. 02: The percentage of the population's voting tendency based on their race and income.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				Through this plot, we can see that the White voters and the Black voters have similar voting patterns across all income categories. 
				On the other hand, Hispanic and others/mixed voters have more people who do not vote compared to White and Black constituencies. 
				This pattern is more apparent for the income category of '$125k or more' and '$40-75k.' 
				We can also observe that the number of people who always vote or sporadically votes decreases as the income category decreases too. 
				The only exception to this is the others/mixed voters: 
				they have more percentage of people who always or sporadically vote in the '$75-125k' income category than the '$125k or more' category.
			</p>

			<p>
				One thing to note about the visualization is that, as according to the information on the main page of this website, 
				the sample population consists much more White voters compared to any other race.
				Therefore, it is much more rational to generalize the voting trend of the White voters compared to other ethnicities.
			</p>

        <h2>The Voting History of the Voters</h2>
			<p>
				Next, we will study the voting history of the surveyed population. 
				The plot below shows what percentage of people voted or did not vote in the six past elections.
				The trend of the percentage of people who voted for each income category are similar to that of Figure 02:
				the people with high income have voted more during the past elections, while the people with low income have voted less.
				The plot also looks like a wave which shows that more people tend to vote for the presidential election than the congressional elections. 
				Thus, we can learn that the population perceives presidential elections more importantly than the congressional election. 
				One event that does not follow this is the Hispanic constituency for the 2010 congressional elections: 
				Hispanic voters with the income category of '$40-75k' and 'Less than $40k' voted more for the 2010 congressional election than the 2008 presidential elections.
			</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="figures/02_time.png" class="responsive">
				<figcaption>Fig. 03: The percentage of the population's voting history based on their race and income.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p>
				On the other hand, the trend of the percentage of people who voted for each racial category resembles that of Figure 02.
				Across all income categories, the Black constituencies have frequently voted the most out of all racial categories, 
				which is followed by the White constituencies.
				The Hispanic constituencies have voted more than the other/mixed constituency for the income of $120k or more,
				while they have voted less for the $75-125k and $40-75k.
				However, for the less than $40k income category, it is difficult to determine whether it is the Hispanics voter or the other/mixed voter who voted more, because, 
				as described above, the Hispanic constituencies voted more for some of the elections while other/mixed constituencies voted more for the other elections.
			</p>

			<p>
				One warning about this plot is that the data have some inconsistency between its voting history and voting tendency categorization.
				The voting history was aggregated based on question 21 of the survey, which asked which of the recent elections did they voted in
				<a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/non-voters/nonvoters_codebook.pdf">[5]</a>.
				However, some people's voting history does not reflect the voting tendency they are categorized as.
				Therefore, this voting tendency categorization may not be the most accurate representation of how the U.S. population votes.
			</p>
        
        <h2>Will the People Vote in the Future Election?</h2>
			<p>
				To further the analyzation, we will study whether if there is any difference on how people plan to vote for the future election
				depending on their race or income.
				<!-- One thing different about this plot is that it is not expressed as a percentage.-->
				Using this plot, we can see that when the income category decreases, there are more percentage of people who decides to not participate in the election.
				This observation is in line with the foundings of figure 02 and figure 03.
				However, with a few exceptions, the proportion of people who plans to vote are similar across all racial categories.
				The few exceptions are the Hispanic constituency of the '$75-125k' income category and the other/mixed constituency for the '$40-75k' category.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				Through data visualization, the voting trend between various racial categories was examined.
				Black constituency tends to have more proportion of people that choose to vote among all income categories, 
				and White constituency is has the second to the largest percentage of people choosing to vote.
				In general, Hispanic constituency has the third to the largest ratio of people choosing to vote, 
				but this may change depending on which election is being discussed.
				Lastly, other/mixed constituency has the smallest proportion of people choosing to vote.
				Yet, when we asked the eligible voters if they plan to vote for the future election,
				within each income category, similar percentage of people answered that they will across all races.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the future, this research can be furthered improved by analyzing why the more votes of a specific race are choosing to not vote compared to other races.
				There could be various factors preventing people from voting or making people choose not to vote.
				For instance, it could be the lack of belief in the United States election system or the difficulty to actually make a ballot.
				Using the question from the surveys conducted by <cite>FiveThirtyEight</cite>, where the dataset used for this analysis came from,
				we can get a closer image of which component of the U.S election system and its nature contributed to the current circumstance.
