        <h1>Analyzing Voting Trend in United States by Race</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            It is a widely known fact that people who vote often are more likely to have high income and higher education
            <a href="https://econofact.org/voting-and-income">[1]</a>.
            We have also found out that young people are more likely to not vote compared to elders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/upshot/youth-voting-2020-election.html">[2]</a>.
            However, there is no clear proposition on people's voting tendencies based on their race &#8212;
            most of the research on voting tendency based on racial demographics only shows the percentage of the voting turnout out.
            They do not study if the people of some specific ethnicities chose to vote or not
            <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/26/what-the-2020-electorate-looks-like-by-party-race-and-ethnicity-age-education-and-religion/">[3]</a>.
            Through analyzing the voting pattern of American population, we will examine if the people vote differently based on their race.
            
        <h2>About the data</h2>

            The data for the research comes from a survey for <cite>FiveThirtyEight</cite> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/non-voters-poll-2020-election/">[4]</a>.
            You can also get the survey data from their GitHub <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/non-voters">[5]</a>.
            In the end, they surveyed 5,355 citizens of the United States. The sample includes 3,710 White people, 932 Black people, 813 Hispanic people, and 381 other/mixed people.
            It also includes 1,394 people who makes more than $125k a year, 1,628 people who makes $75-125k a year, 1,396 people who makes $40-75k a year, and $1,418 people who makes less than $40k a year.
            The following figure a breakdown on how does each race and income makes up the sample population.

            </figure>

            In the end, the sample was weighted to represent the population of the U.S. citizens accurately according to the United States Census Burea.
            One thing to note is that the survey was taken from September 15th to September 25th of 2020, which is before the 2020 presidential elections.
