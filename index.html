        <h1>Are Voting Tendency by Race Similar in the United States?</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            It is a widely known fact that people with high income or higher education are more likely to have a higher voting tendency
            <a href="https://econofact.org/voting-and-income">[1]</a>.
            It is also known that young people are more likely to have lower voting tendency compared to elders 
			<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/upshot/youth-voting-2020-election.html">[2]</a>.
            However, there is no clear proposition on racial disparities in voting tendencies &#8212;
            most researches studying voting tendency by race groups only show the voter turnout ratios.
            They do not study what voting tendency certain ethnic group shows
            <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/26/what-the-2020-electorate-looks-like-by-party-race-and-ethnicity-age-education-and-religion/">[3]</a>.
            Through analyzing the voting pattern of American population, we will examine whether each race group votes differently.
            
        <h2>About the Data</h2>

            The data for the research comes from a survey conducted by <cite>FiveThirtyEight</cite> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/non-voters-poll-2020-election/">[4]</a>.
            The survey data can be found from their GitHub as well <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/non-voters">[5]</a>.
            The survey has asked 5,355 citizens of the United States in total. 
			The sample includes 3,710 White people, 932 Black people, 813 Hispanic people, and 381 other/mixed people.
            By income group, it consists 1,394 people who makes more than $125k a year, 1,628 people of $75-125k a year, 1,396 people of $40-75k a year, and 1,418 people of less than $40k a year.
            The following Figure 1 shows the composition of sample by race and income group.

				</figcaption>
            </figure>

            This composition was weighted to represent the population of the U.S. citizens.
            One thing to notice is that the survey was conducted from September 15th to September 25th of 2020, which is before the 2020 presidential election.

        <h2>Voting Tendency of Each Race Group</h2>
			<p>
				First, we will examine if there are any significant differences in the voting tendencies by race within each income group. 
				The visualization shows what percentage of the people always vote, sporadically vote, or never vote for each racial and income classification.
				Each voting tendencies are defined as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>People who always votes are people who voted for all or all-but-one of the past elections they were eligible.</li>
					<li>People who sporadically votes are people who voted for fewer than all-but-one yet more than once in the past elections they were eligible.</li>
					<li>People who rarely or never votes are people who never voted or voted only once for the past elections they were eligible.</li>
				</ul>
				<figure>

					<figcaption>Figure 2: Stacked bar plots representing voting tendency by race and income group.
						<br>Note: The number above the stacked bar stands for the count of samples in each group.

					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				Through this figure, we can see that the White voters and the Black voters have similar voting patterns across various income level. 
				On the other hand, Hispanic and others/mixed voters are less likely to vote than White and Black constituencies. 
				This pattern is more apparent for the income groups of '$125k or more' and '$40-75k.' 
				We can also observe that the number of people who always vote or sporadically votes decreases as income decreases. 
				The only exception to this tendency is the others/mixed voters: 
				they have a bigger share of people who always or sporadically vote in the '$75-125k' income group than the '$125k or more' group.
			</p>

			<p>
				One thing to pay attention about the visualization is that, White is the largest racial group of the United States constituencies.
				Thus, it is much more rational to generalize the voting trend of the White voters compared to other ethnicities.
			</p>

        <h2>Trend of Voting Tendency in Recent Elections</h2>
			<p>
				Next, we will study the voting trend of the surveyed sample. 
				The plot below shows what percentage of people voted <!--or did not vote--> in the recent six elections.
				The trend of the ratio of people who voted for each income group are similar to that of Figure 2:
				the people with high income have voted more during the past elections, while the people with low income have voted less.
				The plot also looks like a wave which shows that more people tend to vote in the presidential election than the congressional elections. 
				Thus, we can learn that the population perceives presidential elections more importantly than the congressional election. 
				One incident that does not follow this tendency is the Hispanic constituency for the 2010 congressional elections: 
				Hispanic voters with the income groups of '$40-75k' and 'Less than $40k' voted more for the 2010 congressional election than the 2008 presidential elections.
			</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="figures/02_time.png" style="width: 100%;" class="responsive">
				<figcaption>Figure 3: Line plot showing voting tendency by race and income group for the recent six elections.
					<br>Source: Data for the figure comes from <cite>FiveThirtyEight</cite>.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p>
				The trend of the ratio of people who voted for each race group resembles Figure 2 as well.
				Over all income groups, the Black constituencies have frequently voted the most out of all races, 
				then followed by the White constituency.
				The Hispanic constituency have voted more than the other/mixed constituency for the income of $120k or more,
				while they have voted less for the $75-125k and $40-75k.
				However, for the less than $40k income group, it is difficult to determine whether it is the Hispanic voter or the other/mixed voter who voted more, 
				because, as described above, 
				the Hispanic constituency voted more for some of the elections while other/mixed constituency voted more for the other elections.
			</p>

			<p>
				One precaution about this plot is that the data have some discrepancy between its voting history and voting tendency categorization.
				The voting history was aggregated based on question 21 of the survey, which asked respondants in which of the recent elections they voted
				<a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/non-voters/nonvoters_codebook.pdf">[5]</a>.
				However, some people's voting history does not reflect the voting tendency they are classified as.
				Thus, the voting tendency classification of the data may not be the most accurate representation of how the U.S. population votes.
			</p>
        
        <h2>Are People Planning to Vote in the Future Election?</h2>
			<p>
				For further analyzation, we will study whether there is any notable difference 
				on how many people plan to vote in the future election depending on their race or income.
				<!-- One thing different about this plot is that it is not expressed as a percentage.-->
				Figure 4 shows that as income decreases, there are more people who decide not to participate in the election.
				This observation is in line with the findings of Figure 2 and Figure 3.
				However, with a few exceptions, the proportion of people who plans to vote are similar over all race groups.
				The few exceptions are the Hispanic constituency of the '$75-125k' income group and the other/mixed constituency of the '$40-75k' income group.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				Through data visualization, the voting tendency by race and income groups was examined.
				Black constituency has high propensity to vote over all income categories, followed by White constituency.
				Voting tendency of Hispanic constituency is ranked as third place, but this is changeable depending on which election is being considered.
				Other/mixed constituency has the lowest voting tendency.
				When we asked the eligible voters if they plan to vote in the future election,
				similar percentage of people within each income group answered that they will across all races.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the future, this research can be furthered investigated in depth by analyzing 
				why a certain race group has low propensity to vote compared to other races.
				There could be various factors preventing people from voting or making people choose not to vote.
				For instance, it could be the lack of belief in the United States election system or the difficulty in actually making a ballot.
				Using the question from the surveys conducted by <cite>FiveThirtyEight</cite>, where the dataset used for this analysis came from,
				we can have a closer understanding of which component of the U.S election system and its nature contributes to the imbalance of the voting tendency by race groups.
