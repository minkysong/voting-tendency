		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>
				Through data visualization, the voting trend between various racial categories was examined.
				Black constituency tends to have more proportion of people that choose to vote among all income categories, 
				and White constituency is has the second to the largest percentage of people choosing to vote.
				In general, Hispanic constituency has the third to the largest ratio of people choosing to vote, 
				but this may change depending on which election is being discussed.
				Lastly, other/mixed constituency has the smallest proportion of people choosing to vote.
				Yet, when we asked the eligible voters if they plan to vote for the future election,
				within each income category, similar percentage of people answered that they will across all races.

				In the future, this research can be furthered by analyzing why the more votes of a specific race are choosing to not vote compared to other races.
				There could be various factors preventing people from voting or making people choose not to vote.
				For instance, it could be the lack of belief in the United States election system or the difficulty to actually make a ballot.
				Using the question from the surveys conducted by <cite>FiveThirtyEight</cite>, where the dataset used for this analysis came from,
				we can get a closer image of which component of the U.S election system and its nature contributed to the current circumstance.
